[Bookmarklet Source](index.js)(Right-click to save as a bookmark, or drag to bookmark bar)

This JavaScript bookmarklet is designed to be used on the ban list page of a generic SourceBans++ installation, such as the one found at https://www.skial.com/sourcebans/index.php?p=banlist. SourceBans++ is an administration, ban, and communication management system for the Source engine.

When used on the ban list page, the bookmarklet looks for links that contain a specific piece of text, which usually indicates that the link is a Steam profile of a banned player. The script then collects these links, puts them in a list, and shows the list in a pop-up message on the page.

To use this bookmarklet on a SourceBans++ ban list page, save the code as a bookmark and click it while browsing the ban list. The script will then extract the Steam profile URLs of the banned players and display them in an alert.
