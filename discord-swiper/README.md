This JavaScript bookmarklet is designed to collect and display the Discord user IDs, usernames, avatars, discriminators, connected accounts, and mutual guilds of members of a server when used on the web client. It is important to note that you must enable Developer Mode on the web client for this script to work. Additionally, the Authorization header must be set with a valid value at line 130, which you can copy from any request made to the discord.com/api endpoint by the client itself.

The script first observes the members list and scrolls through it to find all members. It then processes the information and displays it in a modal window. To run the script, save it as a bookmarklet and click it while you are on the Discord web client, in a server's member list. Please be aware that frequent use of this script may violate Discord's terms of service, and it is recommended to use it cautiously and responsibly.
