[Bookmarklet Source](index.js)(Right-click to save as a bookmark, or drag to bookmark bar)

This bookmarklet is designed to speed up the process of indexing new players on the results page of the SteamID UK bulk player finder website. When executed on the results page, it will extract all profile links (which have the format "https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/[SteamID]") that are not nested within a table element. The script will then open each profile link in a new browser tab and wait for 3 seconds before closing the tab. This process can help speed up the indexing of new players by allowing the SteamID UK website to scrape their profiles and retrieve their data.
