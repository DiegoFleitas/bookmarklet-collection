[Bookmarklet Source (Right-click to save as a bookmark, or drag to bookmark bar)](index.js)

This JavaScript bookmarklet is designed to work on a YouTube channel page and creates an automatic playlist of all videos uploaded to that channel, even if some videos cannot be embedded. When the bookmarklet is clicked, a new overlay appears on the current page, displaying the playlist in a YouTube player without navigating away. Users can start playing the playlist and use the small arrow symbol on the top left of the player to open it in a new tab.

The bookmarklet code handles various actions and events, such as playing, seeking, and closing the player. It also logs error messages to the console in cases such as invalid parameters or unavailable videos. To use this bookmarklet, navigate to a YouTube channel page and create a new bookmark in your browser. Then, paste the provided JavaScript code as the bookmark's URL and click the bookmark to start playing the playlist.
