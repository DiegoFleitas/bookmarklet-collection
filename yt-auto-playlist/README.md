This JavaScript bookmarklet scans the current webpage for YouTube video links, extracts their IDs and timestamps, and creates an embedded YouTube playlist. When the bookmarklet is clicked, a new overlay appears on the current page, displaying the playlist in a YouTube player without navigating away. The player will start playing the first video in the playlist, and if a video link contains a timestamp, it will start playing from that timestamp. Users can close the player or open the playlist in a new tab.

The bookmarklet code handles various actions and events, such as playing, seeking, and closing the player. It also logs error messages to the console in cases such as invalid parameters, unavailable videos, or issues with embedded players. To use this bookmarklet, simply create a new bookmark in your browser and paste the provided JavaScript code as the bookmark's URL.
