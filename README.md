# Diego's Bookmarklet collection

A collection of old bookmarklets I wrote and still use once in a full moon. Most of them are not actively maintained and may not work as expected today.
Better placed on a repo than among the (too many) bookmarks on my Firefox browser

- [JS Builder](http://subsimple.com/bookmarklets/jsbuilder.htm): A tool for creating and testing bookmarklets.
- [Esprima Validator](https://esprima.org/demo/validate.html): A JavaScript syntax validator to ensure your code is free of syntax errors. (This won't catch comments, remember you can't have those in a single-line bookmarklet :wink:)
