[Bookmarklet Source (Right-click to save as a bookmark, or drag to bookmark bar)](index.js)

This JavaScript bookmarklet helps users quickly import brand-new additions to TMDb into Letterboxd. When clicked, it extracts the movie ID from the current URL and creates a new Letterboxd URL based on that ID, opening it in a new browser tab. This allows users to seamlessly view and interact with newly added movies on Letterboxd as soon as they are available on TMDb.

To use this bookmarklet, create a new bookmark in your browser with the provided JavaScript code as the URL. To import a new addition to TMDb into Letterboxd, enter a URL in this format: https://www.tmdb.org/movie/NEW_ID (replace NEW_ID with the actual numerical ID of the new movie). Click the bookmarklet while on this page, and it will generate the appropriate Letterboxd URL, opening it in a new tab for immediate viewing and interaction.
